 Machine Learning Basics
        Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data.
        It involves training algorithms to recognize patterns and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks.

        Key Concepts in Machine Learning:
        1. Supervised Learning
        2. Unsupervised Learning
        3. Reinforcement Learning
        4. Overfitting and Underfitting

        Machine learning is widely used in various applications, including recommendation systems, image recognition, natural language processing, and more.

        tYpe of Machine Learning Algorithms:
        1. Linear Regression
        2. Decision Trees
        3. Support Vector Machines
        4. Neural Networks
